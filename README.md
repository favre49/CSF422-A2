## Problem 1
The files can be compiled by running `make`

To run with only one open list and n threads, run the command `./puzzle_a n`

To run with k open lists and n threads, run the command `./puzzle_b n k`

A screenshot of the output from each case can be found in the folder. Since the entire output is too long, since it shows every step, only the end has been shown.

## Problem 2
The files can be compiled by running `make`

To run case (a), run the command: `./matrixmul_case_a`
To run case (b), run the command: `./matrixmul_case_b`
To run case (c), run the command: `./matrixmul_case_c`

The output from each case can be found in the folder.
